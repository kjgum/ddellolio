                                They say a glass of wine a day keeps the doctor away. Well, how about six miniature glasses of wine, does that work? And some cheese? I think so! Spend your next weekend at one of the finest wineries in the Garden State and enjoy tours, tastings, entertainment, and the most beautiful scenery New Jersey has to offer!

The 200-year old barn has beautiful limestone walls and oak beam framing that has been wonderfully preserved. This vineyard has won multiple awards and is setting the standard for New Jersey wine. Alba offers daily tastings paired with small bites such as artisan cheeses, flatbreads, fruits, and appetizers with tours available on the weekend.

                                Unionville planted their first vines in 1987 and the winery opened to the public in 1993. The winery sits on over 300 acres of preserved farmland that has once been marched over by George Washington’s troops. The property is part of the Farmland Preservation Program. The vineyard captured a pristine reputation in New Jersey with their single-vineyard Chardonnay receiving 88 points from the Beverage Tasting Institute. This Chardonnay placed higher than an expensive French Burgundy in a wine tasting held in Princeton, NJ. They offer wine tastings seven days a week and have complimentary tours of the vineyard on weekends.

Bill Heritage and his wife Penni converted their 150 acre estate of peach & apple orchards into vineyards and are the fifth generation of farmers who have tended the land. They make a name for themselves with European varieties such as Merlots, Cabernets, Syrahs, and Chardonnays. The 2009 and 2010 Bordeaux Blend received 94 and 93 points from the Beverage Tasting Institute! That is wine worth tasting!

                                John and Debra Basile purchased their farm in 2009 to begin their journey together starting a winery. John has been a home wine maker for around twenty years and is a scientist by trade. Debra has a degree in Agricultural Economics and Environmental Science and knows the art of the land. They opened up their homey tasting room in 2012 where they have wine tastings, and food pairings. John and Debra love to pick up fresh fruit for their wine such as peaches, nectarines, cherries, strawberries, and grapes from neighboring farms! Try their sangria! I heard it’s out of this world and perfect for a warm summer day!
