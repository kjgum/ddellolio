                    <p>This Thursday, August 4th is National IPA Day! Being a
                    hop-head myself I cannot wait to spend my Thursday night
                    trying different IPAs to celebrate this fantastic...
                    necessary holiday. The craft beer scene is exploding with
                    so many varieties of IPAs, there’s one for everyone! Just
                    last year, the most-entered category in the Great American
                    Beer Festival was the <strong>American-Style India Pale
                    Ale</strong> with 336 entries and the <strong>Imperial
                    India Pale Ale</strong> in second place with 208
                    entries.</p>
                    <p>So this Thursday hop into your favorite brewpub,
                    brewery, bar, or fridge, and grab some delicious floral,
                    piney, hoppy buds. If you need some motivation towards a
                    great pick, here are some of my favorites… <a href="/2016/8/2/hoppy_ipa_day">read more</a><br></p>

                                    I don’t always drink Tequila…But when I do, it’s in a margarita. Fruity margaritas, to spicy margaritas, on the rocks, or frozen, the summer sun puts me in a margarita mindset. Here is a list of some of the greatest margarita recipes for your next get together. My favorite is a combo of the fruity and spicy margarita. In Belmar, New Jersey at the 10th Ave. Burrito they have a Spicy Pineapple Margarita with El Jimador Reposado, Pineapple, Habanero, Lime, and cane sugar. One of my favorites!
